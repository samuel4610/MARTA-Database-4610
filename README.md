## Problem Description:

The task at hand is to model and build a relational database for the general operations of the MARTA train system. The central entity in the model is the Train entity — representing each train operating across various routes and stations within the MARTA network. The system operates in conjunction with other key components such as stations, depots, employees, riders, trips, and transactions, all of which interact to deliver reliable transportation services to the public.
We are interested in accurately modeling these relationships, generating sample data, and populating the entities and their attributes with this data. Furthermore, we aim to perform functioning SQL queries on this dataset to gain valuable managerial and operational insights into MARTA’s performance — such as ridership trends, employee productivity, station utilization, and revenue generation across pass types and routes.

## Data Model

Explanation of data model: 

Our model is based on the structure and operations of the MARTA train system.
The Depot entity represents each maintenance or storage facility in which MARTA trains are housed and serviced. Each depot has attributes such as location and capacity. Since a depot manages multiple trains, there is a one-to-many relationship between the Depot and Train entities.
Each Train is categorized by its TrainType, which includes information such as passenger capacity and manufacturer details. This creates a many-to-one relationship from Train to TrainType.
Trains are also assigned to Trips, which record each scheduled journey, including departure time, arrival time, and date — forming a one-to-many relationship between Train and Trip.
Each Trip makes several Stops along its route at various Stations. The Stops entity serves as a linking table between Trip and Station, containing information such as stop arrival and departure times. This establishes a many-to-many relationship between Trip and Station, resolved through the Stops associative entity.
The Station entity represents all MARTA stations across the system, with attributes such as location, name, and operating hours. Each station employs multiple Employees, leading to a one-to-many relationship between Station and Employees. Employees have attributes such as role, hire date, wage per hour, and a self-referencing manager field indicating managerial hierarchy within the same table.
The Riders entity represents passengers who use the MARTA system. Each rider has identifying information such as name, email, phone number, and date of birth. Riders purchase passes through recorded Transactions, forming a one-to-many relationship between Riders and Transaction.
The Transaction entity also connects to PassType, which contains details about the type of pass purchased, such as duration, price, and category. This relationship allows MARTA to track revenue generated by each pass type.
Riders participate in trips through the Trip_Has_Riders associative entity, which connects Trip and Riders in a many-to-many relationship. This table contains additional attributes such as the starting and ending stations for each rider’s journey, allowing for detailed tracking of ridership activity.
Overall, this model captures the operational structure of MARTA — from train deployment and employee management to rider transactions and trip-level data — enabling analytical queries that can reveal operational efficiencies, station performance, ridership trends, and revenue insights across the network.

## Queries:

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 6 37 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229244775-f60ebfa8-49b5-4dc1-95f4-ae027192c111.png)

1. Query 1 lists the number of reservations at each dining establishment that were made for between 6 and 8pm as well as the name of each dining establishment these reservation were made for. The results are also ordered by number of reservations in descending order.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 50 12 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229239154-7637136b-5ddd-400c-9335-f3e571507ed7.png)

Query 1 allows allows managers to see which establishments have received the most number of reservations during their busiest time (6-8pm) which is typically dinner time. These establishments likely need more support, resources, and personnel around dinner time. Therefore, this query allows managers to identify which establishments to allocate this extra help to. Listing the results in descending order of number of reservations makes it easier to see which establishment to prioritize.

2. Query 2 lists the number of dining reservations made by guests on each floor. The results are ordered in ascending order of floor number.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 50 39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229239237-725cac35-598a-49e5-9b5d-bfc96fb18714.png)

Query 2 allows managers to see whether there is a trend between what floor a guest stays on and how much they reserve tabes at the resort's dining establishments. If managers were to find that dining reservations decreased as the floor number increased, it would have possibly indicated that guests were not dining at dining establishments because they felt the distance of the dining establishment from their room was too far and inconvenient.

3. Query 3 lists the information for all the guests who have not made an activity reservation.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 52 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229239403-19acc956-7345-406e-b7ba-a6eaf1c8db88.png)

Query 3 allows the resort to market toward specific customers and contact them (e.g. promotional emails/coupons) about must-try activities. This helps to maximize revenue and increase efficiency by specifically targeting those who are not engaging in activities, rather than wasting time and resources to advertise to those who are already aware of and partaking in these activities.

4. Query 4 lists the names and phone numbers of dining employees who work in the highest rated dining establishment.

A restaurant with a high star rating is a large source of revenue for the resort and management may want to know the names of the employees who work there and how to contact them to reward them for maintaining such a high achieving restaurant (e.g. via a bonus, raise, awards, recognition) or to know which employees to target for continuous training and supervision in order to keep service within the establishment in top shape.

5. Query 5 lists the guests’ names and the hotel they are checking into if their reservation is during the PM, their room is a single or suite, their check in dates are between 2023-04-01 and 2023-04-10, and their hotel rating is above a 4.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 54 41 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229239947-e3c0ab47-c77c-474b-81c1-1b187548b89c.png)

Query 5 allows the resort to manage how busy their check in will be during the PM hours of early April in their better hotels where the check in rooms are singles or suites. This can help the resort determine how many employees need to be working the check in desks to check in single or suite reservations in the afternoon of these dates in these specific hotels.

6. Query 6 lists the names of guests who have over 10 activity reservations and the activities that they have those reservations in.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 55 37 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229240045-10ca60c7-1cb2-49e2-a224-256c841e5fd8.png)

Query 6 allows the resort to determine what guests are contributing the most to each activity’s revenue. The resort may use this information to reward guests who spend the most on activities by offering special prizes and promotions, creating guest loyalty and creating an incentive to reserve even more.

7. Query 7 lists the the amount of dining reservations per guest and the average amount of guests these reservations have.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 56 06 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229240108-152740f1-4c85-4a38-9194-c981cf33fc42.png)

Query 7 allows the resort to see how many guests they should plan to seat, how the tables should be set up, and can lead to the resort figuring out how much revenue should be expected for the average visit.

8. Query 8 lists the guestID, guest name, and the number of room reservations per guest.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 6 34 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229244470-c29f68b3-f837-4a18-97bb-f86345b84431.png)

Query 8 allows the resort to identify their frequent customers and how many times they have stayed. This could lead to a card system down the line. If a guest reaches 5 or 10 visits, there could be a platinum card which would gift the user reservation priority, food discounts, and other perks.

9. Query 9 lists all the rooms along with their average room view rating if the rating is above a 4 star. Additionally, the query is sorted by the view rating and arranged in descending order.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 56 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229240166-bb0bc849-08dd-4521-8608-7a85ff53ae46.png)

Query 9 allows the employees and customers to see which rooms have an average view rating of 4 or more. Rooms with extravagant views are huge attractions to customers and can be a deciding factor when picking which room to stay in. This will help employees find which rooms have the best views fast and efficiently when asked.

10. Query 10 lists the names and prices of all activities offered by the resort that have not yet been booked by any guests and that are less than or equal to $50. Additionally, the results of the query are ordered by price in ascending order.

![Screen Shot 2023-03-31 at 5 57 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128402101/229240218-c01fb32b-5f71-4562-b014-b656bfe051bb.png)

Query 10 allows the employees and customers to see what activities have not been booked yet, and the prices for these activities. The price is sorted in ascending order to make it easier to find the most affordable activities which most people are looking for. Activities are a huge part of the resort experience and using this script will make it easy for employees to find which activities are available as well as the prices for these activities.
